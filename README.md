## 📖 Overview  
**Cookies From Groupies** is a decentralized application (dApp) that bridges the gap between artists and their audiences. It allows artists to build their online profiles, showcase their work, and receive support in creative ways. Fans can explore artist profiles, support them through donations, purchase NFTs, and even stake tokens to share in the yields generated. Supporters unlock exclusive content and gain access to token-gated chats with the artists they support.
